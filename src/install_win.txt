Installing Ascii Pfiles 2.1 In Windows

Before installing ascii pfiles in a Windows system, you should already
have circle installed, compiled, and tested.  See the circle documentation
if you aren't able to do this.

 1)  Copy the included file cr_dirs.bat to your circle30bpl17
     directory (or whatever you've renamed it to)
 2)  Double-click circle30bpl17\cr_dirs.bat in Windows Explorer or
     start a dos window, go to the circle30bpl17 directory, and type
     cr_dirs.bat
 3)  Copy apf2.1_win.patch and patch.bat to circle30bpl17\src
 4)  Make sure you have the GNU "patch" utility by selecting Start | Find |
     Files or Folders..., type patch.exe in the Named box, and typing c:\ in
     the Look In box.  Click Find Now.  If it doesn't find patch.exe, you
     need to get it.  Get it at:      http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/dl/ofc/simtel/v2gnu/pat253b.zip/bin/patch.exe
     You can put it in c:\windows\command to make it executable from anywhere.
 5)  Change to the circle30bpl17\src directory
 6)  Look for existing files with the extension .rej.  If you already have
     some of these files, move them to another directory so they don't
     confuse you later
 7)  Type or double-click patch.bat to patch the source files
 8)  Check again for .rej files.  If you have any now, part of the patch
     failed because your files were not stock circle.  Check the circle wtfaq
     guide at http://developer.circlemud.org for information on how to
     attempt to hand-patch these files.  If you don't get the entire patch
     installed, ascii pfiles will not work.
 9)  If you're using a Visual C++ project workspace, you'll have to add the
     diskio.c, diskio.h, and pfdefaults.h files to the project
10)  Compile and run circle.  If all went well, you won't notice any change
     in the way circle runs.

Note: If you have a completely stock bpl17 mud and don't want to use patch,
you can copy the contents of full_src to your src directory.

Note: If you have existing binary player files you want to convert to ascii,
you can copy the included src\util\plrtoascii.c file to circle30bpl17\src\util
and create a new Visual C++ project workspace for it.  It has not been tested
in Windows, but should work fine.
