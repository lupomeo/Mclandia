Porting Ascii Pfiles version 2.1

All known portability issues have been resolved.  However, only limited
portability testing has been done prior to this release.  All makefiles
included in the stock circle 3.0 bpl 17 release have been modified and
should work, but only Makefile.in has been tested.

This distribution has been tested in FreeBSD 4.1, Slackware 7.1, RedHat
6.2, and Windows 98/MS Visual C++ 6.0.

One possible issue may be the inclusion of sys/stat.h in diskio.c.
Originally I thought this would cause problems in non-unix operating
systems, but if it has, I haven't been told.

If you have any difficulty installing this release in one of the operating
systems supported by stock circle or would like help porting it to any
non-supported OS, please let me know and provide details.
